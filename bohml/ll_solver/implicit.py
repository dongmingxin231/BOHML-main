class Implicit(LLOptimize):
    r"""Lower level model optimization procedure

    Implement the LL model update process.

    The implemented lower level optimization procedure will optimize a wrapper of lower
     level model for further using in the following upper level optimization.

    Parameters
    ----------
        ll_objective: callable
            An optimization problem which is considered as the constraint of upper
            level problem.

            Callable with signature callable(state). Defined based on modeling of
            the specific problem that need to be solved. Computing the loss of LL
            problem. The state object contains the following:

            - "data"
                Data used in the upper optimization phase.
            - "target"
                Target used in the upper optimization phase.
            - "ul_model"
                Upper adapt_model of the bi-level adapt_model structure.
            - "ll_model"
                Lower adapt_model of the bi-level adapt_model structure.

        lower_loop: int
            Updating iterations over lower level optimization.

        ul_model: Module
            Upper adapt_model in a hierarchical adapt_model structure whose parameters will be
            updated with upper objective.

        ll_model: Module
            Lower adapt_model in a hierarchical adapt_model structure whose parameters will be
            updated with lower objective during lower-level optimization.
